# Source-of-truth template for the Homebrew cask. The live copy lives in the
# separate tap repo (abgregs/homebrew-river) at Casks/river.rb and is a
# GENERATED artifact: on each release tag, release.yml substitutes `version`
# and `sha256` (from the published River-x.y.z.dmg.sha256) into this
# template and pushes the result to the tap (planning 0013). Edit the cask's
# shape here — never by hand in the tap. See packaging/homebrew/README.md.

  caveats <<~EOS
    River needs Microphone, Input Monitoring, and Accessibility permissions.
    On first launch, onboarding guides you through granting them in
    System Settings -> Privacy & Security.

    First launch downloads the speech model (~490 MB). Every launch and
    dictation after that is fully on-device.
  EOS

  # `zap` also removes the app-specific model cache (~490 MB, more if other
  # models were tried); a plain
  # uninstall leaves it in place so a reinstall need not re-download it.
