# River Docs

A macOS menu bar dictation app. Hold (or tap) a configurable activation key → capture mic audio → transcribe locally with WhisperKit → type at cursor. Apple Silicon, macOS 14+.

These docs are the source of truth for how River is built and maintained. The working convention: before a non-trivial change, surface the applicable conventions from these docs. Contributing requires no particular agent, harness, or tooling. Doc updates alongside a change are welcome, not a requirement — doc/code drift is caught by the maintainer's automated doc sync ([conventions/doc-maintenance.md](conventions/doc-maintenance.md)).

## Map

### [conventions/](conventions/_index.md)
How code is written: language style, file layout, naming, logging, persistence, tests, git, anti-patterns.

### [architecture/](architecture/_index.md)
How the system is structured and why: process model, the dictation pipeline, the event-tap threading invariant, permissions, configuration, distribution.

### [requirements/](requirements/_index.md)
What the product is supposed to do: the core feature spec, the activation-key/mode design, supported keys, accepted limitations.

### [planning/](planning/_index.md)
Active and future work: the walking-skeleton milestone, milestone roadmap, current focus.

### [design/](design/_index.md)
What the app should look, move, and sound like: the identity brief and the principles each surface is designed against.

### [decisions/](decisions/_index.md)
ADRs — load-bearing architectural decisions and the rationale for *not* taking specific refactors. Read before re-suggesting a known-deferred change.

## Cross-cutting axes

Concerns that cut across categories, where two rules can each be accurate yet conflict. A doc review audits one axis at a time, reading every rule that touches it together.

- **Network behavior** — model downloads, Sparkle's update check, and every "offline" or "on-device" claim. *last audited: 2026-09-29*
- **Permissions and signing identity** — TCC, the capabilities, onboarding, and the dev versus Developer ID signatures. *last audited: never*
- **The cycle state seam** — `RiverState` transitions and every observer: menu bar, panel, sounds, hotkey. *last audited: never*
- **User content privacy** — audio, transcripts, logs, the clipboard, the eval corpus, and release artifacts. *last audited: never*
- **Model storage and lifecycle** — cache location, sizes, loading, switching, and cleanup. *last audited: never*
- **Bundle and release artifacts** — the Makefile, `make verify`, the release workflow's assets, the cask, and the appcast. *last audited: never*

## Conventions of these docs

- Files are kebab-case, single-topic, max ~150 lines.
- Every folder has an `_index.md` listing every file with a one-line summary.
- Rules carry a `**Why:**` annotation when the rationale isn't obvious or when the rule replaces a previous convention.
- Docs cross-link freely: a convention links to the architecture it depends on; a requirement links to the conventions that govern its implementation.

If something is missing or stale, it's a doc bug — a fix alongside your change is welcome, or just flag it; the doc sync will catch it.
