# Conventions: Tests

Use **swift-testing** (the newer framework, `import Testing`, `@Test`, `#expect`), not XCTest. **Why:** swift-testing runs on the toolchain that ships with CommandLineTools — `swift test` works without a full Xcode.app install. XCTest requires the XCTest.framework that only ships with Xcode, which silently excludes contributors who don't have it installed.

One test file per primary type under test, with one exception: the **capability layer is grouped into `CapabilityTests.swift`**, whose `@Suite`s span the `Capability` protocol, `OnboardingGate`, and the three capability implementations. Their per-type surfaces are small and share one `FakeCapability`, so a single file is clearer than five near-empty ones. Suite names mirror the type or concern:

```swift
import Testing
@testable import River

@Suite("RiverSession")
struct RiverSessionTests {
    @Test("activation while idle starts recording")
    func activationWhileIdleStartsRecording() async throws {
        // ...
        #expect(session.currentState == .recording)
    }
}
```

## What is and isn't testable

| Component | Testable? | How |
|---|---|---|
| `RiverSession` (cycle logic) | Yes, fully | Inject fakes for the four managers + a fake `SettingsStore`; drive synthetic activations; observe state publisher |
| `TapStateMachine` | Yes | Pure state machine with injectable clock; feed synthetic key events |
| `HotkeyManager` event interpretation | Yes | Synthesize `CGEvent`s, feed directly into internal helpers; uses a fake `InputMonitoringCapability` so no real tap is created |
| `SettingsStore` | Yes | Inject `UserDefaults(suiteName:)`; assert publisher emissions; assert dedupe behavior |
| `Capability` consumers (managers) | Yes | Inject fake capabilities; assert capability methods are called; assert typed errors propagate |
| `AppState` (Combine→`@Observable` bridge) | Yes | Drive `apply(_:)` directly; assert `state` propagation and that `errorMessage` is path-redacted at the boundary |
| `MenuBarPresentation` mapping | Yes | Pure function; assert icon/label per state and the error-glyph override |
| `Capability` implementations end-to-end | Partial | Inner logic is testable; the OS-call leaf cannot be exercised in CI (no TCC grant) |
| `TranscriptionManager` end-to-end | No | Requires WhisperKit model load, real audio, real Whisper run — not a unit test |
| `TextInsertionManager` end-to-end | No | Requires a real Accessibility grant + a real target app for the paste to land |
| `AudioCaptureManager` end-to-end | No | Requires Microphone grant and real audio input |

**Architectural consequence:** the testable inner logic is now the majority of the codebase. `RiverSession` is fully unit-testable through fakes — the cycle (which used to be the bug-hiding wiring) is the test surface. Capability implementations have a small untestable OS-call leaf, but the consuming managers are fully testable against fake capabilities.

## Access seams for tests

Some methods are `internal` (not `private`) specifically so tests can exercise them without going through real OS APIs:

- `HotkeyManager.handle(_:)` / `bindEventStream()` — interpretation and Combine binding seams, exercised by feeding synthetic `TapEvent`s
- `InputMonitoringCapability.decode(_:)` — pure `CGEvent` → `TapEvent` decoder, `nonisolated` so the C tap callback can call it without crossing an actor boundary
- `InputMonitoringCapability.publishForTest(_:)` — pushes a synthetic `TapEvent` into the stream, bypassing the real tap (which requires an Input Monitoring grant on the running process)
- `MicrophoneCapability.publishForTest(_:)` — pushes a synthetic `AVAudioPCMBuffer` into the stream, bypassing the real engine
- `MicrophoneCapability.skipEngineForTesting` — flag that turns `startEngine()` into a no-op. Required because the test runner usually *does* have Microphone permission, so without it the real engine starts and silent audio races with `publishForTest` buffers (M4 got this for free because `tapCreate` returns nil without IM grant; mic capture has no natural skip)
- `AudioCaptureManager.convert(_:from:toSampleRate:)` — pure buffer-list → 16 kHz `[Float]` conversion via `AVAudioConverter`, exercised on synthetic 44.1 kHz buffers
- `TranscriptionManager.filterSpecialTokens(_:specialTokenBegin:)` — pure custom-dictionary prompt-token filter; tested on synthetic token lists so the load-bearing "drop everything `>=` `specialTokenBegin`" rule has a regression guard (a single mis-typed `<=` would silently corrupt decoding — `requirements/custom-dictionary.md`)
- `TranscriptionManager.resolveWithEmptyPromptRetry(promptTokens:decode:)` — the narrow decode seam (planning 0014, ADR-0001-consistent — a closure, **not** a `Transcriber` protocol). Takes an injected `(promptTokens:) async throws -> String` decode step, so the "a custom-dictionary prompt can only ever help" retry rule (prompted no-speech → unprompted retry; both empty → `.emptyTranscription`; both annotation-only → `.noSpeechDetected`, planning 0023) is asserted without a live WhisperKit model. Production passes the real `decode`; tests pass a canned fake. Extracting the full `Transcriber` protocol stays deferred until ADR 0001's success-path-injection trigger fires deliberately (`requirements/custom-dictionary.md`)
- `TranscriptionManager.isNonSpeechAnnotation(_:)` — pure whole-output classifier for Whisper's non-speech labels (`[BLANK_AUDIO]`, `(heavy breathing)`, …), which the pinned decode gates do not reliably suppress (probed on-device with real quiet-room/breath/keyboard clips — planning 0023). Annotation-only output becomes the session's quiet no-op instead of pasted literal text; mixed annotation+speech output is never touched
- `RiverSession.wireHotkeyCallbacks()` — wires `onActivate`/`onDeactivate` without starting the tap, so the chain can be tested end-to-end via `publishForTest`
- `RiverSession.handleActivate()` (sync) / `handleDeactivate()` (async) — state-guarded transitions; tests `await` `handleDeactivate` directly to drive the full `.recording → .processing → .idle` cycle on the test's own timeline, rather than waiting for the Task-wrapped callback the production wiring uses
- `TextInsertionManager.chunk(_:maxUnits:)` — the pure, grapheme-safe splitter for keystroke injection (planning 0011); unit-tested for the unit budget and surrogate-pair safety. The `CGEvent.post` leaf stays untestable in CI; manager tests assert the down+up-per-chunk count via `AccessibilityCapability.postedEventCountForTesting`
- `AccessibilityCapability.skipPostForTesting` — flag that short-circuits the real `CGEvent.post`. Required because the test runner's trustedness leaks into the test process, so without it `postKeyEvent` would fire a real paste into whatever app was focused at test time (mirrors `MicrophoneCapability.skipEngineForTesting`)
- `AccessibilityCapability.setStatusForTesting(_:)` — drives `status` synchronously, bypassing `recheck()`'s non-deterministic host TCC read, so a test can lock the `postKeyEvent` gate open or closed
- `AccessibilityCapability.postedEventCountForTesting` — counts the posts that `skipPostForTesting` suppressed, so manager tests assert the capability was asked to post the expected number of events without a real `CGEvent.post`
- `AccessibilityCapability.trustReadForTesting` — replaces the `AXIsProcessTrusted()` read inside `recheck()`, so tests pin that status is exactly the OS trust read and nothing else can downgrade it
- `AccessibilityCapability.classifyFocusedTarget(role:subrole:)` — the pure editable-role table behind the paste guard (planning 0001), tested against a role table (editable / non-editable / unknown-fails-open) with no AX grant; the focused-element read leaf stays untestable in CI
- `AccessibilityCapability.focusedTargetForTesting` — pins the focused-target classification so manager tests never reach the real AX read (the host's live focus at test time would leak into the classification); mirrors `skipPostForTesting`
- `*Capability.map(...)` — the pure status-mapping functions, internal so tests pin the granted/denied/unknown mapping without a real TCC grant
- `RiverSession.configurationApplyCount` / `configurationDeferCount` — internal counters so tests can assert subscription wiring without reaching into the handler closures
- `AppState.apply(_:)` — the two update entry points (`RiverState` and `RiverError`), internal so tests drive observation and the redaction-at-the-boundary choke point without standing up SwiftUI or a live session
- `MenuBarPresentation.visual(state:hasError:modelLoadState:)` — pure `state` + error + load state → icon/label mapping, exercised directly so the [core-feature.md](../requirements/core-feature.md) item 5 icon/label contract has a regression guard without a real `MenuBarExtra`. The cycle states return a glyph asset name, which is also the bundle's filename contract (`make verify` asserts those files ship)
- `RiverIndicatorPresentation` / `RiverIndicatorFrame` — the recording indicator's pure motion (level smoothing, motion floor, ink, clock rate, crest window and travel, strand geometry), ported number for number from the study page (planning 0028). Its expected values were produced by running that page's own JavaScript, so the tests pin the port to the approved reference rather than to itself
- `RiverMarkRenderer.draw(_:time:reduceMotion:in:)` — the one drawing shared by the live `Canvas` and the snapshot harness, so a held frame rendered for review is the shipped drawing, not a copy of it
- `ActivationKeyOption.all` / `capsLockHoldWarning(keyCode:mode:)` — the pure activation-key table and the mode-aware Caps Lock/Hold warning predicate, tested so a dropped key or changed warning copy is a failing test, not silent drift (mirrors `MenuBarPresentation`)
- `TranscriptionManager.evaluateDictionaryPrompt(wavPath:)` — internal seam for the **A/B eval harness** (`DictionaryEvalTests`): decodes one fixed clip with and without the dictionary prompt, bypassing the empty-fallback, so a recorded clip shows whether the prompt biases or degenerates. The harness is **env-gated** (`.enabled(if: RIVER_AB_WAV)`) so the normal suite skips it; it loads the real model and writes its result to `ab-result.txt`. Used to confirm `small.en` biases where `base.en` empties (`requirements/custom-dictionary.md`)
- `TranscriptionManager.loadAudioSamples(fromPath:)` — internal seam for the **transcription eval harness** (`TranscriptionEvalTests`, planning 0022): wraps WhisperKit's `AudioProcessor.loadAudioAsFloatArray` so WhisperKit stays a single import boundary and the test target need not depend on it. Not used in production (live capture supplies samples directly)

Mark them clearly:

```swift
// internal for testability (CGEventTap cannot be created in CI)
func decodeFlagsChanged(_ event: CGEvent) -> ActivationEdge? { ... }
```

**Do not promote these to `public`.** Internal is enough; public is an API contract.

## Fake capabilities

Capabilities are `final` and own real OS calls, so fakes conform to the `Capability` **protocol** rather than subclassing a concrete type. A single `FakeCapability` covers status, onboarding, and gate tests:

```swift
@MainActor
final class FakeCapability: Capability {
    let displayName: String
    let setupInstructions: String?
    private let subject: CurrentValueSubject<CapabilityStatus, Never>
    private(set) var requestGrantCount = 0

    init(displayName: String = "Fake", setupInstructions: String? = nil, status: CapabilityStatus = .denied) {
        self.displayName = displayName
        self.setupInstructions = setupInstructions
        self.subject = CurrentValueSubject(status)
    }

    var status: AnyPublisher<CapabilityStatus, Never> { subject.eraseToAnyPublisher() }
    var currentStatus: CapabilityStatus { subject.value }
    func set(_ status: CapabilityStatus) { subject.send(status) }   // drive transitions in tests
    func recheck() async {}
    func requestGrant() async { requestGrantCount += 1 }
    func openSystemSettings() {}
}
```

Tests substitute these into `OnboardingGate`, managers, and `RiverSession` to exercise scenarios (denied, unknown, grants late) without OS interaction. An action-specific manager test can use a purpose-built protocol-conforming fake that records calls (e.g. posted events for `TextInsertionManager`).

## Test isolation

- Tests that touch `UserDefaults` directly must use a per-test suite name:
  ```swift
  let defaults = UserDefaults(suiteName: "test-\(UUID().uuidString)")!
  defer { defaults.removePersistentDomain(forName: ...) }
  ```
  Most tests will use a fake `SettingsStore` instead and avoid `UserDefaults` entirely.
- Tests must not depend on test execution order.
- Tests must not require network, microphone, or accessibility permissions.

## Running

```bash
swift test                                       # all tests
swift test --filter RiverSessionTests        # one suite
swift test --filter "activation while idle"      # one test
```

If a test requires a permission or external resource and can't be made hermetic, mark it `.disabled` with a reason and document the gap in `docs/planning/_index.md`:

```swift
@Test(.disabled("requires accessibility grant; run manually before release"))
func endToEndPaste() { ... }
```

## Harnesses and generated assets

Three test suites do more than assert: they render the shipped art, and they measure real
models against real audio. Their rules live in [test-harnesses.md](test-harnesses.md) —
the env-gated writer/checker split, why the assets are generated from `Constants`, and the
eval corpus format.
