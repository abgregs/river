# Conventions: Doc Maintenance

`docs/` is kept in sync with the code by an automated, scheduled maintainer routine — the doc-sync routine — not by contributors. This file is the routine's spec: the routine's prompt is a thin pointer here, so editing this file changes the routine's behavior. Design rationale and decision history: [../planning/0015_automated-doc-sync.md](../planning/0015_automated-doc-sync.md).

## Trigger and schedule

- A GitHub Actions workflow ([.github/workflows/doc-sync.yml](../../.github/workflows/doc-sync.yml)) runs the routine via `anthropics/claude-code-action` on a cron schedule — 13:00 UTC on the 1st and 15th of each month. GitHub auth is the job's repo-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN`; Claude auth is the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repository secret (credential rationale: [0015](../planning/0015_automated-doc-sync.md)).
- Manual runs: trigger the workflow's `workflow_dispatch`, optionally passing an explicit historical base for testing the pipeline against known drift. A base-override run must **not** advance the cursor.
- The workflow performs the run's exit-early checks deterministically before invoking the model: an empty range or an open doc-sync PR ends the run with zero tokens consumed; a missing or diverged cursor fails it.
- GitHub auto-disables cron workflows after 60 days without repository activity; re-enable from the Actions tab if notified.

## Range semantics

- **State is the git branch `doc-sync/cursor`** — its tip is the last commit a completed run covered. PR-body `Covers:` lines are informational only.
- Each run reviews the half-open range `doc-sync/cursor..origin/main`, where the head is `origin/main`'s SHA snapshotted at run start; commits landing mid-run wait for the next run.
- On successful completion — including a clean, nothing-to-report run — fast-forward the cursor to that head. `main` is append-only (force-push blocked), so the fast-forward never needs force. A failed or aborted run leaves the cursor untouched.
- Bootstrap (one-time, all done by the maintainer — the routine never creates these itself): the `doc-sync/cursor` branch (at the merge commit of 0015's implementation PR), the `doc-sync` PR label, and the repository setting **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** (Settings → Actions → General) — without it, `gh pr create` from the workflow is blocked and every run with findings aborts.
- All dates (branch names, run records) are UTC.

## A run, start to finish

1. **Exit early**, without advancing the cursor, if:
   - `doc-sync/cursor` is missing or is not an ancestor of `origin/main` → abort loudly; never guess a range;
   - the range is empty → nothing to do;
   - a doc-sync PR is still open — identified by the `doc-sync` label and the routine's author identity, never by branch name alone → the pending commits are covered next run.
2. **Review.** Read the range's diff and commit messages (and the PR bodies its merge commits reference, via `gh`). Navigate from `docs/_index.md` through the category `_index.md` files to the docs covering the changed areas. For each relevant doc: still accurate? still complete? Classify every drift finding per the confidence rubric into a proposed edit or a flag.
3. **Adversarial pass.** Independently re-verify every proposed edit against the rubric before applying it, with the burden of proof on the edit. Deliberate intent must be evidenced — a `**Why:**` line in a commit body, an explicit PR-body statement, or a planning doc; "it merged" proves nothing, since every commit on `main` arrives via a self-merged PR. Check closed doc-sync PRs: an edit substantially identical to one the maintainer closed is demoted to a flag citing that PR. Edits that fail the pass or are uncertain demote to flags.
4. **Land.** Apply surviving edits on a fresh branch (naming below) as conventional `docs:` commits per [git.md](git.md), updating the relevant `_index.md` files and keeping every touched doc under ~150 lines. A rejected push (branch already exists) aborts the run — never force-push. Edits or flags present → open one PR; neither → no PR. Either way the run is complete — fast-forward the cursor per Range semantics.

## The confidence rubric

- **Edit** (still gated by the adversarial pass and the maintainer's PR review):
  - a convention or behavior deliberately and *completely* replaced, with the docs now contradicting the code;
  - references to renamed or removed symbols, files, or settings;
  - landed work whose planning status is stale (`current-focus.md`, `_index.md` markers).
- **Flag, never edit:**
  - partial migrations — both patterns coexist; surface the conflict, don't average it;
  - drift against the platform invariants below — code drifting from those docs is a suspected regression to report, never a doc update;
  - code that departs from a project convention or decision — `AGENTS.md` rules 3–5, [anti-patterns.md](anti-patterns.md), anything under `docs/decisions/` — reported with its evidence and presumed wrong on neither side; the maintainer decides whether the code or the doc changes;
  - doc deletions beyond line-level edits;
  - anything whose intent cannot be evidenced.
- **The platform invariants**, enumerated by location, not adjective: `AGENTS.md` rules 1–2; [../architecture/threading-invariant.md](../architecture/threading-invariant.md). They describe macOS behavior that fails silently, so code is presumed wrong when it drifts from them. Everywhere else, merged code is the source of truth and the docs follow it, except that conventions and decisions are flagged rather than edited (above). Doubt about whether something is a platform invariant is itself a flag.
- The routine never edits code, never force-pushes, never creates tags, and never merges or approves its own PRs.

## PR format and lifecycle

- Branch: `docs/doc-sync-<UTC date>-<short unique suffix>` (the suffix keeps a same-day retry from colliding). Label: `doc-sync`. Title mirrors the lead commit. Body: the [git.md](git.md) PR skeleton, plus:
  - `Covers: <base>..<head>` — the reviewed range, for context;
  - **Flagged for maintainer** — a `- [ ]` checklist: each flag with its evidence (the commits, the docs, the contradiction). Unchecked flags from the most recent prior doc-sync PR — merged or closed — carry forward until checked off or moot. Carried-forward flags attach to the next PR that opens; they do not themselves trigger one.
- A flags-only run has no doc edits, so the branch carries one allow-empty `docs:` run-record commit. **Why:** GitHub refuses a PR with no commits; this is the documented exception to git.md's no-content-free-commits norm.
- Merging accepts the edits. Closing rejects them — a later run that re-derives a rejected edit flags it instead of re-proposing. For partial acceptance, edit the branch before merging rather than closing.

## Failure behavior

- Abort loudly and cleanly on anything unexpected — a missing or diverged cursor, a rejected push, a `gh` failure. An aborted run leaves no branch, no PR, and an unmoved cursor, and surfaces as a failed workflow run (the workflow converts the routine's abort marker into a nonzero exit).
- Never widen scope to "fix" the repo: no code edits, no tag pushes, no merges, no cleanup of unrelated branches.
