How code is written in River. Read what's relevant before changing code in that area.

- [swift-style.md](swift-style.md) — naming, access control, file layout, when to extract types

- [persistence.md](persistence.md) — `UserDefaults` keys, defaults, observation

- [test-harnesses.md](test-harnesses.md) — suites that render the shipped glyphs and app icon from `Constants` (and fail on drift), plus the env-gated dictionary and transcription eval harnesses
- [git.md](git.md) — branches, conventional commits, stacked PRs, what touches `main`
- [doc-maintenance.md](doc-maintenance.md) — the automated doc-sync routine's spec: how `docs/` stays synced with the code, the confidence rubric, and the PR lifecycle
- [versioning-and-releases.md](versioning-and-releases.md) — tag-driven release protocol, SemVer rules, the two macOS version fields, per-channel update behavior

- [anti-patterns.md](anti-patterns.md) — explicit "do not do this," with the why
