# Architecture: Distribution

Three channels, two signing identities, one stable bundle ID.

## Channels

1. **Source build** (devs) — clone, run `swift build`, install via the Makefile target. Local-signed.
2. **Homebrew cask** (power users) — `brew install --cask abgregs/river/river` (from the `abgregs/homebrew-river` tap) pulls the latest signed `.dmg`.
3. **GitHub Releases `.dmg`** (general users) — signed and notarized, drag-to-`/Applications`.

The App Store is intentionally not a channel. **Why:** the sandbox forbids global event taps, which would require redesigning the activation hotkey around a much weaker mechanism. See [overview.md](overview.md).

## Two signing identities

| Identity | Used by | Source | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|---|
| **River Dev** | Local installs via Makefile | Self-signed certificate in user's login keychain | Persistent across rebuilds on a developer machine |
| **Developer ID Application** | DMG releases and Homebrew cask | Apple Developer Program ($99/yr) | Tied to the Apple developer account |

Local builds always use River Dev. **Why:** ad-hoc signing produces a new code-directory hash on every build, which invalidates TCC entries (Accessibility / Input Monitoring), forcing the user to re-grant permissions every rebuild. A persistent local identity is *supposed* to keep grants stable across rebuilds — but see the correction below: that only holds for grants the app *requested*; it does **not** hold for rows added manually in System Settings, which is currently the only way Accessibility can be granted at all.

## Permissions across installs and rebuilds (field-corrected 2026-08-18)

The previous revision of this doc claimed TCC grants stick across rebuilds under the persistent identity. On-device experience during the 0004/0021/0002 smoke falsified that for Accessibility. The corrected model:

- **Rows created by tccd via a request API survive rebuilds.** Microphone (granted through the native `AVCaptureDevice.requestAccess` prompt) carried across a `make install` rebuild untouched. tccd records these against the signing identity, which the persistent cert keeps stable.
- **Pane-added Accessibility rows survive same-identity rebuilds too — but the app *reads* denied at launch.** Repeated rebuilds (2026-08-19) showed the lighter recovery works every time: Grant (Settings shows the row already on) → back → Refresh → granted. No reset, no re-add. So the row persists. **Corrected 2026-09-15:** the launch-time "not granted" was never `AXIsProcessTrusted()`, which logged granted on every launch. It was the app's own delivery probe racing an asynchronous event post, on every launch and not only after rebuilds; the probe is removed ([0012](../planning/0012_onboarding-permissions-polish.md) section 6).
- **Genuinely stale rows are the heavy case.** A row created against a *different* identity (the Homebrew-era build, or any identity churn) shows enabled in Settings while tccd refuses the running binary, and Refresh never helps. Recovery: quit → `tccutil reset Accessibility com.river.app` → re-add fresh via **+** → relaunch. Toggling the stale row is a no-op.
- **The structural fix is 0012** ([planning/0012](../planning/0012_onboarding-permissions-polish.md)): call the request APIs so tccd owns durable rows for Accessibility and Input Monitoring the same way it does for Microphone.
- **Release-channel users are on the durable path.** Developer ID + notarized builds keep one stable identity across upgrades (cask reinstall, Sparkle updates), so end users don't ride this edge. The one hard rule: never install a differently-signed build *over* a cask-owned app — uninstall the cask first (the 2026-08-14 lesson), or grants break with the same Settings-says-granted confusion.

Release builds use Developer ID. **Why:** macOS Gatekeeper warns sharply on Developer ID-unsigned downloads; for an app that asks for Accessibility this kills trust. Developer ID + notarization makes the app a first-class macOS citizen.

## What a source-build contributor is trusting

Two facts to understand before running `make install` and granting permissions:

- **The self-signed certificate is not scoped to River.** Once "River Dev" exists in the login keychain, any process running as your user can sign with it. It confers no system trust — Gatekeeper still treats the result as unidentified. Its only job is keeping the code-directory hash (and therefore TCC grants) stable across rebuilds.
- **Granting Microphone + Input Monitoring + Accessibility to a self-built, non-notarized binary is the highest-trust permission set macOS has.** Nothing vouches for the binary except the source you built it from. The architecture keeps that reading tractable: each gated OS call has exactly one call site, in the corresponding [capability](capabilities.md).

## Bundle ID is load-bearing

The bundle ID is `com.river.app`. It must:

1. Be present in `Info.plist` as `CFBundleIdentifier`.
2. Match what's inside the `.app/Contents/MacOS/River` binary's code signature.
3. Stay stable across versions.

**Why:** TCC keys all permission grants by bundle ID + code signature. Changes to either look like a different app. Users see ghost entries in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility and have to re-grant. Most users will give up. See [permissions.md](permissions.md).

A bundle without `Info.plist` (or with a different `CFBundleIdentifier` than the binary) is *worse* than no signature at all: macOS may accept it for Input Monitoring but refuse synthetic key event posting (silently). This is exactly the failure mode that bricks the paste pipeline.

## The build script must produce a valid bundle

This is non-negotiable and documented in [../conventions/anti-patterns.md](../conventions/anti-patterns.md). Specifically:

- `.app/Contents/Info.plist` must exist and contain `CFBundleIdentifier`, `CFBundleName`, `CFBundleVersion`, `CFBundleShortVersionString`, `LSUIElement`, `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`.
- `.app/Contents/Resources/` must contain `River.icns` (the app icon) and the six menu bar glyph PNGs, all copied by `make bundle`. `make verify` fails if any is missing or if `Info.plist` has no `CFBundleIconFile`. **Why:** SwiftPM has no asset pipeline for a hand-rolled bundle, so nothing but the Makefile puts these files in place — and a bundle missing them shows a blank Finder icon and an empty menu bar slot, with no runtime error (the same build-time-or-never posture as the bundle identifier).
- `codesign` must be invoked with `--entitlements path/to/River.entitlements --sign "River Dev"` (or Developer ID for releases).

Prefer using `xcodebuild` or `swift build` plus a tightly verified bundle-assembly step over a hand-rolled script. If a hand-rolled script is unavoidable, its first commit must include a check that `codesign -dv` on the output reports the expected bundle ID.

## WhisperKit model cache

First launch downloads the model identified by `Constants.defaultModel` (currently `openai_whisper-small.en`, ~240 MB) to `~/Library/Application Support/River/models/argmaxinc/whisperkit-coreml/<model>` (set via WhisperKit's `downloadBase`). Subsequent launches reuse the cached copy — only the first run sees the download cost. **Application Support, not WhisperKit's `~/Documents/huggingface` default:** Documents is TCC-protected, so downloading there triggers an "access your Documents folder" prompt and clutters the user's Documents — see [../planning/0010_relocate-model-cache.md](../planning/0010_relocate-model-cache.md).

The sandbox is intentionally off (see [permissions.md](permissions.md)), so the cache lives outside the app container and survives reinstalls. This is the **only** network behaviour in the app (see [../requirements/core-feature.md](../requirements/core-feature.md) item 6).

## Releases

- Tag a release: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`. `v*` tags are protected — deletion and force-push are blocked (see [../conventions/git.md](../conventions/git.md)).
- [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release.yml) builds the tagged commit, signs with Developer ID (reusing `make` so the bundle-integrity check from [anti-pattern #3](../conventions/anti-patterns.md) runs on the release build too), notarizes the app and the DMG via `xcrun notarytool`, staples both, and publishes the `.dmg` + a SHA-256 checksum to the GitHub Release. Required secrets, one-time setup, and how to cut a release are in the [release-pipeline runbook](release-pipeline.md). First run: `v0.1.0` (2026-06-22).
- The Homebrew cask ([`../../packaging/homebrew/river.rb`](../../packaging/homebrew/river.rb)) points at the release `.dmg` and pins its published `sha256`.

Versioning rules and the tag-driven protocol are in [../conventions/versioning-and-releases.md](../conventions/versioning-and-releases.md).

## Updates

How an installed copy learns about a newer version differs by channel:

- **GitHub Releases `.dmg`** — [Sparkle](../planning/0009_sparkle-auto-update.md) provides in-app auto-update. The app embeds a `SPUStandardUpdaterController` (owned by `UpdaterManager`, wired from `AppDelegate`) that reads the `SUFeedURL` appcast the release workflow publishes on each tag; a "Check for Updates…" menu item triggers a manual check. **First launch:** Sparkle shows its built-in "check for updates automatically?" consent prompt before any network request, keeping the app's *second* network behaviour (after the WhisperKit model download) opt-in and transparent — consistent with [../requirements/core-feature.md](../requirements/core-feature.md) item 6. Updates are EdDSA-signed and verified against the embedded `SUPublicEDKey`, independent of Apple notarization.
- **Homebrew cask** — pull-based: `brew upgrade` (or `brew upgrade --cask river`) picks up new versions on the user's own schedule; Homebrew never notifies proactively. A release only becomes visible to Homebrew once the cask's `version` + `sha256` are bumped in the tap ([packaging/homebrew](../../packaging/homebrew/README.md)).
- **Source build** — `git pull` + `make install`.

The Homebrew cask is marked `auto_updates true` so `brew upgrade` defers to Sparkle instead of fighting it (planning 0009).
