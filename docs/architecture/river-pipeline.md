# Architecture: River Pipeline

One full cycle from keypress to pasted text. `RiverState` is the lock; [`RiverSession`](river-session.md) is the only writer.

## States

```
.idle ──key down──> .recording ──key up──> .processing ──transcribe done──> .idle
```

- **.idle** — accepting new activations.
- **.recording** — mic is capturing into `AVAudioPCMBuffer`s; new activations are ignored.
- **.processing** — engine torn down, WhisperKit running, paste pending; new activations are ignored.

Re-entrancy is safe: every transition is guarded by `guard state == expected` before mutating. Stale callbacks log and return.

## Steps

1. **[`InputMonitoringCapability`](capabilities.md)** owns the `CGEventTap` on `.flagsChanged`. It exposes raw flag-change events as a typed stream. **`HotkeyManager`** consumes that stream, interprets it against the configured `ActivationKey` and `ActivationMode`, and fires semantic `onActivate` / `onDeactivate` callbacks. Hold mode is interpreted inline (key-down activates, key-up deactivates); the tap modes route each completed tap through **`TapStateMachine`** (a single completed tap, or a confirmed double-tap within ~400 ms). The machine keeps only the double-tap timing: whether a tap starts or stops comes from the session's own state, which `RiverSession` supplies as `HotkeyManager.isRecording`, so a start the session refuses leaves nothing out of step and the next tap starts again.
2. **`RiverSession.handleActivate`** transitions state to `.recording` and asks `AudioCaptureManager` to start.
3. **`AudioCaptureManager`** (using [`MicrophoneCapability`](capabilities.md)) taps the input node in **hardware format** (whatever the device gives us — typically 44.1 / 48 kHz) and accumulates copies of `AVAudioPCMBuffer`. **Why hardware format and not 16 kHz at capture time:** doing sample-rate conversion inside the tap callback risks losing audio if the converter stalls. Convert at stop time instead.
4. On **`onDeactivate`**, `RiverSession` asks `AudioCaptureManager.stopRecording()`. The manager waits briefly for the first buffer if none arrived yet (see "Engine warmup" below), then concatenates buffers and converts to 16 kHz mono Float32 via `AVAudioConverter`.
5. **`TranscriptionManager.transcribe(audioSamples:)`** runs WhisperKit with `DecodingOptions.promptTokens` seeded from the custom dictionary term list (always empty since the V1 dictionary cut — [0008](../planning/0008_custom-dictionary-redesign.md) — so V1 decodes unprompted; the plumbing and this rule guard the redesign). **Custom-dictionary tokenization rule:** filter out tokens >= `tokenizer.specialTokens.specialTokenBegin`. **Why:** special tokens injected into `promptTokens` corrupt decoding silently.
6. **`TextInsertionManager.insertText(_:)`** first runs the **insertion guard**: a read-only focused-element role check via `AccessibilityCapability.classifyFocusedTarget()`. A clearly non-editable target (a focused button, a dev-tools DOM selection) is skipped with `TextInsertionError.noEditableTarget` — "No text field focused" surfaced via the `errors` publisher; an undeterminable role fails open. Otherwise it injects the transcription as **Unicode key events** (`CGEvent.keyboardSetUnicodeString`, chunked to ~20 UTF-16 units per event — `Constants.keystrokeChunkUnits`), each routed through [`AccessibilityCapability.postKeyEvent(...)`](capabilities.md), the one `CGEvent.post` site, which refuses if status isn't `.granted`. **The clipboard is never touched** — no snapshot, no restore, no clipboard race ([planning 0011](../planning/0011_keystroke-injection.md)).
7. `RiverSession` sets state back to `.idle`. If a configuration change arrived during the cycle (see [river-session.md](river-session.md) on deferred reconfiguration), it is applied here.

## Engine warmup

`AVAudioEngine.start()` returns synchronously, but the input-tap callback only fires once the engine has produced its first buffer (~60–100 ms warmup). A short tap that ends inside that window would otherwise drop the entire utterance.

`AudioCaptureManager.stopRecording()` therefore waits up to **300 ms** for at least one buffer to arrive before tearing down. Normal-length presses are unaffected — the wait loop exits immediately when buffers already exist.

## No AX-API path

Text insertion is **synthesized input events** through `AccessibilityCapability` — Unicode key events via `CGEvent.keyboardSetUnicodeString` ([planning 0011](../planning/0011_keystroke-injection.md)). There is no Accessibility-API *write* path. **Why:** AX writes require per-app focus targeting that is brittle across browsers, Electron apps, and terminal emulators. Synthesized keystrokes are uniformly supported wherever typing works, and they touch nothing but the focused field.

Earlier the mechanism was clipboard + synthesized ⌘V with a save/restore around it; 0011 replaced it to eliminate a clipboard-restore race (the restore could land before a slow target consumed the paste). Keystroke injection is input-event synthesis — the same `CGEvent` family as the ⌘V it replaced — **not** an AX write, so the decision to avoid AX writes still holds. The clipboard is no longer involved at all.

**One read-only exception — the insertion guard** ([planning 0001](../planning/0001_focused-element-paste-guard.md)): before injecting, `TextInsertionManager` asks `AccessibilityCapability.classifyFocusedTarget()` to read the system-wide focused element's AX role (`AXUIElementCreateSystemWide` → `kAXFocusedUIElementAttribute` → role/subrole) and skips injection when the role is clearly non-editable, throwing `TextInsertionError.noEditableTarget` before any keystroke is posted. An undeterminable role **fails open** — insertion proceeds exactly as before. This refines rather than reverses the decision above: what was rejected is AX *writes* as the insertion mechanism; the guard is a role *read* that only gates whether insertion runs, and the read happens in `AccessibilityCapability` so AX calls keep a single owner.

## Capability failures are typed errors

If `AccessibilityCapability.postKeyEvent` throws (status not `.granted`), it does so on the first injected event — before any character lands — and `TextInsertionManager` rethrows; `RiverSession.handleDeactivate` catches the error, logs at `.error` (path-redacted per [ADR 0002](../decisions/0002-log-redaction-over-debug-flag.md)), and returns to `.idle`. There are now **two** user-visible surfaces:

- **Permission-revoked path** — structural. A recheck that reads `.denied` updates the capability, which `OnboardingCoordinator` observes as a `.granted → !.granted` transition and re-presents onboarding with permission-specific copy.
- **Transient cycle failures** (a momentary `cghidEventTap` refusal, a transcription or capture error) — the session emits a typed `RiverError` on its `errors` publisher. [`AppState`](app-state-and-menu-bar.md) bridges that to the menu bar, which shows a warning glyph over the idle icon plus the (path-redacted) message. The emission never blocks the return to `.idle`.

This is the surface the menu-bar visual-state milestone landed (it brought the renderer and the `errors` publisher together, as planned). It is **not** a substitute for the permission path above — a genuinely denied capability still routes through onboarding, not a transient toast.

Audio capture follows the same pattern via `AudioCaptureError` (`.noAudioCaptured` when no buffer arrives in the 300 ms engine-warmup window; `.conversionFailed` when `AVAudioConverter` errors). `RiverSession.handleDeactivate` catches both, logs at `.error`, and still returns to `.idle` — getting stuck in `.processing` would freeze the cycle. Note: `MicrophoneCapability.startEngine` itself does **not** throw (a failure to start logs a warning; the capability's `status` is the surface that signals "engine won't work" upstream to onboarding). The fail-loud surface is `stopRecording`, which is where "did we actually capture audio" becomes knowable.
